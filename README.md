# Rust - Noughts And Crosses
## Small description
A VERY basic Rust game of Noughts and Crosses (or Tic Tac Toe depending where you're from).

## Longer desrcription
In order to test my recently learned Rust programming knowledge I decided to make a basic program/project.

I figured an easy challenge should be making a game of Noughts and Crosses which I could somewhat
overcomplicate to test myself.

Obviously this won't contain the best Rust practices, but I think it is fairly good for someone who learnt
the Rust language within the last 3 days.

Either way, enjoy I guess?
